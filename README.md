# c_json

A small library meant to provide an interface for json files meant as a learning exercise.

Does not comply fully with the [JSON standard](https://www.json.org/json-en.html), for example: does not parse unicode hex digits of the format \uXXXX in strings.
As such, if you need a library to work with JSON I would recommend to pick one listed at the bottom of the page of the [JSON standard](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).
